# BloodRelations
Blood Bank app developed for the Smart India Hackathon 2017

## The Team

## Problem Statement
Mobile App for real time inventory of blood availability during disasters, in the affected area or close proximity and for contacting blood and platelet donors when needed to donate at the nearest blood bank utilizing geo tracking
Geographic mapping of blood banks and blood storage centers in the country to provide better access to blood

## Idea
We plan to develop an app where in donors as well as receivers can connect to a blood bank in their vicinity using geo-location. People can register on the app and fill in details regarding their medical history, hence creating a digital medical certificate. When in need, receivers can notify the blood bank regarding their requirements (blood/platelets). If available, the blood can be sent to the concerned medical institution or the blood bank can send a notification to all the donors in that area's vicinity who belong to the required blood group to come and donate blood.
One blood bank can check/collaborate with other blood banks regarding availability of resources in times of mass crisis.
